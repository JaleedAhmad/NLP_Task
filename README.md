# üß† Natural Language Processing Projects ‚Äî Elevvo Internship

This repository contains my completed NLP projects from the **Elevvo Internship (September‚ÄìOctober 2025)**.  
Each task focuses on applying core and advanced Natural Language Processing techniques using real-world datasets and modern Python libraries.

## üöÄ Overview

During this internship, I explored multiple aspects of NLP ‚Äî from traditional text classification to transformer-based deep learning models.  
All projects were implemented in **Python** using tools like `Pandas`, `Scikit-learn`, `NLTK`, `spaCy`, `Gensim`, and `Hugging Face Transformers`.
